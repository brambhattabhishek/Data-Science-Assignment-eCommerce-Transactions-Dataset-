# Data-Science-Assignment-eCommerce-Transactions-Dataset-# Customer Segmentation and Lookalike Model Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains the solution for the **Customer Segmentation and Lookalike Model** assignment. The assignment involves the application of data science techniques to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build a lookalike model for customer recommendation, and perform customer segmentation using clustering. The goal is to gain business insights, recommend similar customers based on their profiles and transaction history, and segment customers based on their behaviors.

# Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights

**Objective**: Perform exploratory data analysis on the provided dataset and extract at least 5 business insights from the data.

**Deliverables**:
- `Abhishek_Brahmbhatt_EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA code.
- `Abhishek_Brahmbhatt_EDA.pdf`: PDF report with the business insights.

---

### Task 2: Lookalike Model

**Objective**: Build a lookalike model that recommends similar customers based on their profile and transaction history. The model should assign a similarity score to each recommendation.

**Deliverables**:
- `Abhishek_Brahmbhatt_Lookalike.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook explaining the development of the lookalike model.
- `Abhishek_Brahmbhatt_Lookalike.csv`: CSV file containing the top 3 lookalike customers and their similarity scores for customers C0001 - C0020.

---

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering

**Objective**: Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques, considering both customer profiles and transaction data. Visualize the clusters and calculate relevant clustering metrics, including the DB Index.

**Deliverables**:
- `Abhishek_Brahmbhatt_Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for clustering and segmentation.
- `Abhishek_Brahmbhatt_Clustering.pdf`: PDF report with clustering results, including metrics and visualizations.
